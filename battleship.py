"""A script to test strategies for the game of battleship.

An naive strategy -- random_shot() -- is provided.

Each strategy should be specified as a function that takes
in the game board and returns the coordinates for a shot.

The game board renders 0s as untargeted spaces. -s as misses,
and X for hits. Unlike the game, the strategy function will not 
get information about which boats have been sunk.

For the standard game, there are five boats:
1 boat of length 5
1 boat of lenght 4
2 boats of length 3
and 1 boat of length 2
