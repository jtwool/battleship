Battleship
===========
A script to test strategies for the game of battleship.


### High scores

Strategy | Avg. Shots | Avg. Duration
---------|------------|---------------
[Horizontal Sweep](./strategies/horizontal_sweep.py) | 89 | .004s
[Random](./strategies/random_shot.py) | 95 | .004s


### Description

Each strategy should be specified as a function that takes
in the game board and returns the coordinates for a shot.

The game board renders 0s as untargeted spaces. -s as misses,
and X for hits. Unlike the game, the strategy function will not 
get information about which boats have been sunk.

For the standard game, there are five boats:
- 1 boat of length 5
- 1 boat of length 4
- 2 boats of length 3
- 1 boat of length 2

If you report your high scores (avg. shots and time per 1k runs),
and send in the code for your strategy, I'll post the results here. (PRs appreciated.)

## Designing a `shoot_function`
Shoot functions should take the game board in and return two integers:
the coordinates of the desired shot. The first integer represents the 
row targeted and the second integer represents the cell targeted.

A 3x3 game board may look like this:

```python3
[[0, 0, 'X'],
 [0,'-', 0],
 [0, 0,  0]]
```

On this board, the cells 1,1 and 0,2 have been shot at.
Cell 1,1 was a miss -- represented by a `'-'` and cell 0,2 was a hit
represented by an `'X'`.

The shoot function would take this board and return another pair of coordinates,
for example: `(0,1)`.

Two example shoot functions are provided for reference: [random_shot.py](strategies/random_shot.py) and [horizontal_sweep.py](strategies/horizontal_sweep.py).

### Multi-language support

You can design shoot functions in any language you wish, using the [battleship_cli](./battleship_cli.py). This utility takes an executable script and uses that script as the shoot function. These shoot functions should expect a JSON array as input -- the board -- and print (only) a JSON array as output -- the location to shoot at next.

An example script is provided for reference: [standalone.py](strategies/standalone.py)

**NB**: Functions in languages other than Python will take longer to run because of system overhead.
